## Overview
A switchboard is a distribution of one or more circuits.
The switchboard has one or more supply circuits from other circuit board, generators, og transformers. 

## Data

| dataType              | description       |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| parent_id             | If this switchboard is supplyed from a parent switchboard, this is the ID of parent switchboard.                                      |
| parentCircuitID       | Circuit ID from the parent switchboard we are supplied from.                                                                          |
